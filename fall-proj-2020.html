              <p>
                <b><i>Description: </i></b>This was the final project for
                “Circuit for Engineers”. It was an electronic version of the
                game Generala, also known as Yahtzee or dice Poker. The dice
                were represented by a circuit of 4060 microcontrollers and 6
                LEDs each, showing the rolled value. A push-button is used to
                “roll” the dice. A counter system made of LEDs showed the time
                left in the game. A PCB divided the power from two 9V batteries
                into the counter and the dice portions of the project.

                <b><i>My role:</i></b> I planned and built all circuitry. I was
                also the team leader, setting the vision and milestones for the
                project.

              cooks about the state of the food, allowing users to “cook outside

              <h6>Fall 2020</h6>
              <p>
                <b><i>Description:</i></b> This was the final project for “Data
                Analysis for Engineers”. As a passionate baker (and cook), I
                have heard multiple well-know bakers recommending metal pans for
                baking brownies “evenly” across the pan. However, my personal
                experience said that glass or ceramic pans made for brownies
                with better “moisture”. I set the purpose of this project was to
                test that hypothesis: to identify how the pan material affects
                the overall humidity of the brownies and evaluate how humidity
                changes across the different locations of the slice. We used a
                humidity sensor to measure the brownie’s humidity for glass,
                ceramic, and metal plans and across the brownie slice (border,
                middle, and center). It was found that there was no statistical
                difference between ceramic and glass pans, and these were
                different from metal pans. Moreover, there was no statistical
                difference across the slice for none of the pan materials.

                <b><i>My role:</i></b> As the team leader, I was responsible for
                road-mapping the project. Moreover, I baked all 9 batches (3 for
                each pan material) and helped with the measurements and data
                analysis.

            <h5>The Acidity Indicator, a pH Alerting Control System</h5>
            <h6>Fall 2020</h6>
            <p>
              <b><i>Description: </i></b>For this “Data Analysis for Engineers”
              project, my client was a chef who wanted to find the acidity level
              of the perfect tomato sauce. Tomatoes are one of the most acidic
              fruits. As the base for tomato sauce, their acidity is always a
              concern. If the issue is not addressed, the result is an
              unenjoyable dish in which the acidity overwrites the other
              flavors. Therefore, a very methodic Italian chef (possibly myself)
              was interested in finding a way to detect this. To solve the
              issue, I created a control system for reading the pH levels of
              tomato sauce, with a speaker that warns the chef whether it is too
              acidic or too basic. I used LabVIEW to run the program and a data
              acquisition system, DAQ, to digitize the signals.The system turns
              on by pressing a button and an LED displays that it is
              functioning. The pH sensor then reads data, and depending on the
              pH level, the mini speaker (buzzer) alerts the chef.
